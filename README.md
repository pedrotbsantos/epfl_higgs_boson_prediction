## Machine Learning Project
finding the Higgs boson

*Group: Maxime Schoemans, Pedro de Tavora Santos and Yannick Paul Klose*

### Structure of Code
The code is structed in 3 different components, with are represended by the following notebooks:

##### "Data Cleaning.ipynb"
Here we cleaned the dataset. The data will be stored as .npy files for later access.

##### "Computing Model.ipynb"
Here we trained our model, with our cleaned train data

##### "Apply model on Test Data.ipynb"
Here we applied our model on the test dataset. 


The Dataset was from Kaggle (original CERN Dataset)
